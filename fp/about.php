 <h2>About Body n' Soul Massage</h2>
    
<p>Every body is different and my goal is to intuitively customize the massage to meet your needs. Each massage will include some of my favorite modalities that I've studied over the years.  You can expect a session to integrate myofascial release and osteopathic tecniques, neuromuscular therapy, craniosacral therapy, shiatsu, and medical massage. I also offer reiki energy healing and aromatherapy during each massage for a complete circle of body and energy work.</p>

<p>Since opening Body n' Soul in 2000, I continue to be passionate about learning new techniques that will facilitate healing to the individual needs of my clients. Taking charge of our own health is important. I believe in self-care and nurturing our bodies with exercise, proper nutrition, and holistic wellness. Preventative healthcare and finding balance in life is the key to being our best self and I'd love to help you on your path to wellness.</p>
